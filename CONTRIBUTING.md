# Contributing

All skill levels are welcome to contribute! But if you'd like to dive deeper, the project uses the following technologies:

- The server side code is written in [Go](https://go.dev/)
- The frontend code is written using minimal JavaScript
  - Using [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for dynamic loading
  - Using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for any extra dynamic bits
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is used for any database needs

Familiarizing yourself with those technologies will help make you able to contribute to the project. And of course, it will help to know HTML and CSS.

Contributions from 1RG members are preferred.
